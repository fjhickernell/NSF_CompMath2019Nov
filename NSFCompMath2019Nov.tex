%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Our problem}

Each large-scale simulation for grand-challenge problems, such as modeling global climate change, can require hours or even days of high performance computation.  This simulation output can be viewed as a real-valued function or map, $f$, defined on a $d$ dimensional set of input parameters of interest (POIs), $\Omega$.  The quantities of interest (QOIs) might be 
an inexpensive representation of the simulation output (the identity map) or the optimal output:\footnote{Other possible QOIs include the location of the optimum output and (parametric) integration.}  
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ourQOIs}
    \QOI(f) = \ID(f) := f \qquad \text{and} \qquad \QOI(f) = \MIN(f) := \min_{\bx \in \Omega} f(\bx).
\end{equation}
Our problem is to numerically approximate these QOIs when $d \in [10, 100]$ and the feasible number of simulations, $n$, is relatively small, say in the hundreds.  The primary time cost of our algorithms is in obtaining the output, $f(\bx_1), \ldots, f(\bx_n)$, not the cost of manipulating the output.

Numerical algorithms for approximating these QOIs take the form $\APP(n,\mX,\by)$, where 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mX := (\bx_1, \ldots, \bx_n)^T \in \Omega^{n} \subseteq \reals^{n \times d}$ is a well chosen \emph{design}, i.e., an array of POI vectors or data sites, and
    
    \item $\by := \bigl(f(\bx_1), \ldots, f(\bx_n) \bigr)^T \in \reals^n$ is a vector of (noiseless) \emph{output} data.
\end{itemize}   
The $n$-dependence of $\mX$ and $\by$ is implicit.  

Limited computer resources and the curse of dimensionality prevent acquiring a dense sample in the input space, $\Omega$. Adaptive sampling uses past data as a guide in choosing future data sites.   That is, $\bx_{n+1}$, depends on both $\mX$ and  $\by$ and is chosen to maximize the expected value, $\VAL$, it will bring to the $\APP$s:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:nextsample}
    \bx_{n+1} = \argmax_{\bx \in \Omega} \VAL(\bx,n,\mX, \by)~.
\end{equation}
Here $\VAL(\bx,n,\mX, \by)$ measures the value to $\APP(n+1,\cdot,\cdot)$ in observing $f(\bx)$, based on what has been already observed.  The $\VAL$ function is sometimes called an acquisition function and  typically depends on a measure of uncertainty or error in $\APP(n,\mX,\by)$.

The uncertainty or error in $\APP(n,\mX,\by)$ must also be inferred from data, which mandates data-driven bounds error of the form 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:errbd}
    \bignorm[\calg]{\QOI(f) - \APP(n,\mX,\by)} \le \ERR(n,\mX,\by) \qquad \forall f \in \calc,
\end{equation}
either absolutely or with high probability.  Here, $\norm[\calg]{\cdot}$ corresponds to some function space norm for function approximation and the absolute value for minimization.  These error bounds in \eqref{eq:errbd} are valid for $\calc$,  precisely defined sets of well-behaved output maps, $f$, between the input POIs and the simulation outputs.  These error bounds allow the user to decide whether additional data is needed to improve the accuracy of $\APP(n,\mX,\by)$.


\subsection{Our goal}

The PIs---Yuhan Ding (YD), Fred J Hickernell (FJH) and James ``Mac'' Hyman (JMH)---propose to find
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better numerical approximations, $\APP$, for function approximation and optimization, especially in the case when $d$ is large and $n$ is small, which are based on
    \item Better adaptive sampling acquisition functions, $\VAL$, that depend on both the past sample locations $\mX$ and the output data, $\by$, which depend on
    \item Rigorous (not heuristic) data-driven error bounds, $\ERR$, which are valid for
    \item Precisely defined sets---which will turn out to be cones---of output maps, $\calc$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Our plan} \label{sec:OurPlan}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our plan follows the two-stage \emph{explore-exploit} sampling process and relies on surrogate models (meta-models, function approximations) for $f$, denoted $\SURR(n,\mX,\by)$, with data-based measures of uncertainty, denoted $\SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)$.  In the \emph{explore} stage, little or nothing is known of the output or the QOIs, and the sampling does not depend on output data.  We sample $f$ on a relatively sparse, but space-filling, set of $n_0$ data sites over, $\Omega$ the region of feasible POIs.  This initial design must be large enough to detect important features of $f$ that influence $\QOI(f)$, but small enough to be economical. 

Based on the initial sample of size $n=n_0$, we construct approximate QOIs, denoted generally by  $\APP(n,\mX,\by)$.  For the two QOIs in \eqref{eq:ourQOIs} these correspond to a surrogate model and the minimum output observed:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:QOIhat}
    \APPID(n,\mX,\by) = \SURR(n,\mX,\by), \qquad \APPMIN(n,\mX,\by) = \min_{1 \le i \le n} y_i.
\end{equation}

We focus on surrogate models, $\SURR(n,\mX,\by)$, that arise from local least squares  or from kriging (or minimum norm interpolants in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs)).  Other surrogate models are possible. We derive data-based measures of uncertainty for our surrogate models, $\SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)$ valid for sets of output maps $\calc$ such that 
\begin{equation}
    \abs{f(\bx)-\SURR(n,\mX,\by)(\bx)} \le \SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)(\bx) \qquad \forall f \in \calc
\end{equation}
either absolutely or with high probability.
\begin{itemize}
\item For local least squares models we will measure the uncertainty via a weighted Bayesian bootstrap approach (Sect.\ \ref{sec:Bootstrap}).
\item For kriging models we will use the data to infer the   covariance/reporducing kernel and to construct credible intervals (Sect.\ \ref{sec:kerinferdata}).
\end{itemize}
Because the primary time cost in our problems is acquiring output data, we are not overly concerned about the time required to generate surrogate models and to assess their uncertainties.

The \emph{exploit} stage uses surrogate models based on all past samples, $\SURR(n,\mX,\by)$, together with their uncertainties, $\SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)$, to detect regions where $f$ is poorly represented with respect to its influence on $\APP(n,\mX,\by)$.  For $\APPID$ the surrogate model needs to represent $f$ well throughout its domain, $\Omega$, while for $\APPMIN$ the surrogate model only needs to represent $f$ well near potential minima. This information is then used to optimize the placement of future samples that reduce the uncertainty in the subsequent  QOIs. 

The acquisition function, $\VAL(\bx,n,\mX, \by)$, guides us in choosing the next data site, $\bx_{n+1}$.  For function approximation, $\VAL(\bx,n,\mX, \by)$ corresponds to a pointwise error bound on the surrogate model, and for  minimization,  $\VAL(\bx,n,\mX, \by)$ corresponds to the expected improvement in the approximation to the minimum:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:QOIval}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:idval}
     \IDVAL(\bx,n,\mX,\by) &= \SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)(\bx), \\
     \label{eq:minval}
      \MINVAL(\bx,n,\mX,\by) &= \APPMIN(n,\mX,\by) - [f(\bx) - \SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)(\bx)], 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The next data site, $\bx_{n+1}$ maximizes the acquisition function (see \eqref{eq:nextsample}).   The acquisition functions are related to the uncertainties or error bounds for the QOIs:
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:QOIerr}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:iderr}
     \bignorm[\infty]{f - \APPID(n,\mX,\by)} &\le \norm[\infty]{\SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)} =: \IDERR(n,\mX,\by), \\
     \label{eq:minerr}
     \bigabs{\MIN(f) - \APPMIN(n,\mX,\by)} & \le \max_{\bx \in \Omega} \Bigl\{ \APPMIN(n,\mX,\by) - [f(\bx)- \SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)](\bx) \Bigr\} \\
     \nonumber
     & =: \MINERR(n,\mX,\by).
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The exploit stage repeats until the time budget is exhausted or the uncertainty tolerance is met.

Because function approximation and optimization are homogeneous problems, i.e., $\QOI(cf) = c\QOI(f)$ for all $c \in \reals$, our algorithms and error bounds are also constructed to be homogeneous.  It then follows that our sets of functions $\calc$, for which the error bounds are guaranteed, are \emph{cones}, i.e., $f \in \calc \implies cf \in \calc$.




\iffalse
One approach we are considering is create an ensemble of surrogate models by resampling the current samples.  That is, we iteratively 
\begin{enumerate}
\item resample the data using a weighted Bayesian bootstrap approach, where $\btheta$ represents different sample weights (Sect.\ \ref{sec:Bootstrap}),
\item Create a surrogate model based on the weighted/resampled data using either 
\begin{itemize}
\item fitting kriging or RKHS models where the parameter $\btheta$ determining the form of the  covariance/reporducing kernel is inferred from the data (Sect.\ \ref{sec:kerinferdata}), or 
\item multivariate polynomial models where the importance of different POIs and their interaction terms is mediated by $\btheta$ (Sect.\ \ref{sec:selectCoord}).
\end{itemize}
\item Evaluate the surrogate model at candidate sample locations to identify where the surrogate model has the most variance. 
\end{enumerate}
When the QOI is function approximation or optimization, then $\APP_{\btheta}(n, \mX, \by)$ will the approximation of $f$.  When the QOI is the integral may be approximated directly or may be the integral of a function approximation. Because the primary time cost in our problems is acquiring data, we are not overly concerned about the time required to generate the ensemble of surrogate models $\APP_{\btheta}(n, \mX, \by)$.

\fi

\subsection{Our impact}
\subsubsection{Theoretical advances}
The theoretical advances for error estimates will extend mathematical foundation for adaptive sampling by 
\begin{itemize}
\item Providing error bounds, $\ERR$, based on both the sample locations and function values and justified for input functions in $\calc$, and 
\item Providing acquisition functions, $\VAL$, based on both the sample locations and function values and justified for input functions in $\calc$, which indicate where the next data location should be.
\end{itemize}
Rather than focus on asymptotic convergence rates, our theory will be pre-asymptotic, applicable for the situation in which output data is expensive.

\subsubsection{Algorithms}
By utilizing adaptive sampling algorithms will create more computationally efficient algorithms, $\APP$.
\renewcommand{\descriptionlabel}[1]{\hspace{\labelsep}\textit{#1}.}
\begin{description}
\item[Function approximation] We will create a surrogate models, with uncertainty estimates, that represent the output well over the entire feasible range of POIs using a minimal number of samples.  This model can be used for global sensitivity analysis and dynamic (interactive) visualization of the response surface. 
\item[Optimization] We will use our surrogate models to identify multiple local optima of the response function.  The local minima can then be used to identify as starting locations for gradient descent algorithms.

\underline{Los Alamos Sea Ice Model}  \notes{Hunke has agreed write a letter of collaboration JMH}
Accurate climate predictions depend on understanding role the that sea ice plays and how the ice couples with the ocean and atmospheric models.
%About nine million square miles of sea ice float on top of the world’s high-latitude seas and oceans. Sea ice helps keep polar regions cool. It is constantly in motion and constantly changing internally. It influences Earth’s climate, wildlife, and people who must contend with it year-round. Sea ice makes navigation difficult, creating challenges for commercial shipping, mining and energy development, fishing, hunting, tourism, scientific research, military bases, and defense operations.  
We will collaborate with Elizabeth Hunke (Los Alamos National Laboratory) to apply our methodology to predicting the sea ice environment.   Hunke is the principal developer of  Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE) \cite{hunke2017cice, hunke2010cice}. This model incorporates physical effects of the atmosphere and ocean on the ice, and accounts for the physical feedback mechanisms between the sea ice and the full Earth climate system models. Each CICE simulation can take hours to run, even on the world's fastest computers.

Under the influence of wind and ocean currents, the  fresh ice moves on the ocean surface, and melts.  The melting creates a layer of fresher water that disrupts the ocean convection and vertical motion.  This effect could modify the global “conveyor belt” (Gulf Stream) of heat moving through the world’s oceans and disrupt the entire Earth's environment. 
   
Hunke and her colleagues have conduced 150 CICE model runs selected to space filling in the 39 dimensional  space of feasible  parameters.   Of these, only about 100 of the runs were successful, due to parameter induced instabilities.  They then added an additional 400 low discrepancy Sobol samples in regions where the simulation was stable.  In their preliminary studies, they confirmed that creating surrogate models for high-dimensional function, such as their 39 dimensional sample space, is difficult and not practical using the standard approaches \cite{bengio2006curse, o2010oxford}.  We will use our two-step surrogate model to identify the active parameters and predict the response between the sample points.  

Our goal is will be to collaborate with Hunke (see the letter of collaboration) and quantify the sensitivity of the model predictions for sea ice coverage and volume with respect to 39 model parameters.  We will then identify the parameters where the next runs are predicted to most reduce the uncertainty in the surrogate model.
    
  
\underline{Volcanic Impact on North Atlantic Oscillation:}\notes{I'm writing to get a letter of collaboration for this project. This is a placeholder until I get the approval to use the data. JMH}
Large tropical volcanic eruptions inject ${SO_2}$ into the atmosphere where it is converted into sulfate aerosols.  These aerosols reflect short-wave radiation and cause changes in the climate system including surface and sea surface temperatures, zonal and meridional winds, global precipitation patterns and more \cite{zanchettin2013background, legrande2015volcanic}.  Such large perturbations in the climate system have the ability to cause major global change in climate patterns.

We will collaborate with Kostas Tsigaridis and Allegra LeGrande to help guide large-scale simulations using the The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) climate model E2.1-R to investigate the impact of volcanic eruptions on the climate
\cite{zanchettin2016model}.  MH is mentoring Helen Weierbach's undergraduate honor's thesis at Tulane using our surrogate model for some preliminary studies.  Last summer she was an undergraduate research intership at GISS and pa


After initial sampling and processing, sensitivity analysis will be used to quantify how sensitive the model is to initial NAO phase. Quantities of interest including geopotential heights and wind anomalies in the troposphere and stratosphere and sea level pressure in the North Atlantic basin will be analyzed in the NAO parameter space. A relative sensitivity index for each parameter will be used to measure the sensitivity of the polar vortex to initial NAO conditions.


\subsubsection{Software}
Our algorithms will be implemented in open source libraries for use by the modeling community.  The software will include the following routines:
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Surrogate models:} We will consider surrogate models based on both distance weighted least squares (DWLS) quasi-interpolation methods and kriging.  
These methods consider the distance and function values when estimating values in unknown areas. The interpolated values can be expressed as a weighted linear combination of the known sample values. 

These methods assume that the influence of a function value decreases with distance.  We use a Gaussian kernal for the weights in DWLS with variance depending on the distance to the samples neighboring the location where it will be evaluated.
The uncertainty in the interpolated values can be estimated by  by refitting the data, where the DWLS Gaussian weights are reweighted (multiplied) by Bayesian bootstrap weights.  

In kriging,  the distance between the sample points defines the spatial correlation that can be used to predict variation in the surface. We will compare the DWLS with the DACE kriging MATLAB algorithm \cite{}. \notes{talk about variance estimation with kriging.  Do we want to talk about Gaussian process models? JMH}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Algorithms for Univariate Problems} \label{sec:localadpat}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
FJH, STSC, YD, XT, YZ and collaborators developed several adaptive algorithms for univariate integration, function approximation, and optimization \cite{ChoEtal17a,HicEtal14b,  Din15a, Ton14a, Zha18a}.  Most of these algorithms are \emph{globally adaptive}---the sampling density is constant (equally spaced data sites), but the number of data sites is chosen adaptively to meet the error tolerance.

However, the function approximation and integration algorithms constructed by FJH, SCTC, YD, and XT in \cite{ChoEtal17a} are \emph{locally adaptive}, meaning that the sampling density is non-uniform and influenced by the function data.  Qualitatively, the cone of functions for which these algorithms are guaranteed to succeed consists of functions where the maximum of the second derivative in a sub-interval is not drastically smaller than the larger of it's minimum value to the immediate left or right.  For function approximation, the adaptive sample is denser where $\abs{f''}$ is larger, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{localadaptfig}.  This locally adaptive function approximation algorithm has a computational cost of $\Order\left(\sqrt{\norm[1/2]{f''}/\varepsilon} \right)$, where $\varepsilon$ is the error tolerance, and is essentially optimal.  An intriguing aspect is the appearance of the $1/2$-quasinorm $\norm[1/2]{f''}$, which may be much smaller than 
$\norm[\infty]{f''}$ for peaky functions.

\subsubsection[QMCsec]{Globally Adaptive Cubature Based on Space-Filling Designs} \hypertarget{QMClink}{}
\label{sec:QMC}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
FJH, LlAJR, DL, and JR developed globally adaptive algorithms for approximating $d$-dimensional integrals,  $\int_{[0,1]^d} f(\bx) \, \dif \bx$, based on space-filling designs \cite{HicJim16a,HicEtal17a,JimHic16a}.  Two common space-filling or low discrepancy designs are integration lattice nodes and digital sequences \cite{DicEtal14a}.  Fig.\ \ref{PtsFig} contrasts these two designs with independent and identically distributed (IID) data sites, which are not so space-filling.

\begin{figure}[h] % MATLAB Driver: PlotPoints.m
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{ProgramsImages/IIDPoints.eps} \quad
	\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{ProgramsImages/ShiftedLatticePoints.eps}  \quad
	\includegraphics[width = 0.25\textwidth]{ProgramsImages/SSobolPoints.eps} 
	
	\caption{IID data sites contrasted with two families of space filling data sites.\label{PtsFig}}
\end{figure}

The error bounds underlying the adaptive cubatures developed by FJH, LlAJR, DL are based on the Fourier coefficients of the sampled function values on these space-filling designs.  The Fourier  \{complex exponential/Walsh functions\} bases are chosen to match the \{lattices/digital sequences\}  designs, which makes the cubature error bounds possible.  The globally adaptive cubatures increase $n$ by powers of two until the error bounds are no greater than the error tolerance, $\varepsilon$.

The cones, $\calc$, of integrands for which these adaptive cubatures are guaranteed are those for which  the Fourier coefficients, $\bigabs{\hf(\bk(\kappa))}$ decay steadily, but not necessarily monotonically, in magnitude.  Fig.\ \ref{GoodBadWalshFig} displays a typical function inside $\calc$ and one outside $\calc$. Here $\bk(0), \bk(1), \ldots$ is a natural ordering of the $d$-dimensional wavenumbers.  The function lying outside the cone appears to have high frequency noise. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{A function inside $\cc$ for which the adaptive algorithms are guaranteed and another function with high frequency noise lying outside $\cc$.
	\label{GoodBadWalshFig}}
\end{figure}

A different approach was taken by FJH and JR, who assumed that the integrand is an instance of a Gaussian process with constant mean $m$, and covariance kernel, $K:[0,1]^d \times [0,1]^d \to \reals$.  The same space-filling designs are used as are pictured in Fig.\ \ref{PtsFig}.  A $99\%$ credible interval for the integral is constructed.  The sample size, $n$, is increased until the half-width is no greater than the error tolerance, $\varepsilon$, the algorithm terminates.  The hyper-parameters, $m$ and the parameters defining the covariance kernel, $C$, may be treated by empirical Bayes (maximum likelihood estimation), full Bayes, and/or cross-validation \cite{RatHic19a}. 

The major contribution of FJH and JR is to speed up the computational cost required by this Bayesian cubature.  Bayesian cubature requires operations
involving the Gram matrix $\mK$ defined in \eqref{appxExOne}, and ordinarily these operations  have a cost of
$\Order(n^3)$.  FJH and JR chose covariance kernels, $K$, which matched the space-filling designs and reduced the computational cost to $\Order(n 
\log(n))$, making Bayesian cubature practical.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Multivariate Function Approximation} \label{sec:PrevFunAppx}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

FJH, YD, and LlAJR and collaborators investigated the function approximation problems for Banach spaces, $\calf$, defined by general series representations \cite{DinHic20a,DinEtal20a}.  For example, the bases can be general multivariate polynomials.  Three different definitions of cone, $\calc$, of functions were defined, all describing a reasonable behavior of the series coefficients.  Adaptive function approximation algorithms were constructed for these three cones shown to be essentially optimal.  The shortcoming of this research is that the algorithms use series coefficients as data rather than function values.

\section{Intellectual Merit of the Proposed Research} \label{sec:Proposed}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Existing Adaptive Sampling Schemes and Their Shortcomings} \label{sec:shortExist}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As a prelude to describing our proposed approach to adaptive sampling, we summarize the existing literature \cite{aute2013cross,burnaev2015adaptive,fu2017adaptive,gramacy2008adaptive,jin2002sequential,kleijnen2004application}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Adaptive Space Filling Designs}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A number of popular adaptive design criteria are constructed based on an acquisition function, that does not depend on the simulation output data, but only on the data sites, i.e., $\VAL(n,\mX,\by) = \VAL(n,\mX)$.  Such adaptive designs fill in wholes in the existing design according to a particular criteria.  Some of these criteria include 
\begin{description}
    \item[Discrepancy] This measures the difference between the empirical distribution of the design and the target (usually uniform) distribution \cite{FangEtal19a}.  Examples of low discrepancy designs are given in Fig.\ \ref{PtsFig}.  
    \item[Covering radius or fill distance] This is the minimum radius needed for balls centered at each data site to cover the whole domain, $\Omega$.  Minimax designs minimize this criterion.
    \item[Minimium distance between data sites]  Maximin designs maximize this criterion \cite{jin2002sequential}.
    \item[Entropy] Designs maximizing entropy seek to maximize the information when choosing the next data site \cite{jin2002sequential}.  They also typically assume a known Gaussian process model.
\end{description}
Orthogonal arrays and Latin hypercube sampling are further examples of space filling designs, although they are not usually constructed sequentially.  

While space filling designs are useful for the exploration stage, they are inadequate for the exploitation stage of our adaptive algorithms because they do not include the output data in a meaningful way.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Cross-Validation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This approach to adaptive sampling involves measuring the variation in predictions based on leaving out one observation at a time \cite{aute2013cross,jin2002sequential, kleijnen2004application}.  However, the tendency is often to pick the next data site close to an existing one \cite{jin2002sequential}, which is wasteful.  A fix has been proposed to include a penalty that discourages choosing the next data site close to an existing one \cite{aute2013cross,jin2002sequential}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Minimizing Prediction Error} \label{sec:MinPredErr}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some existing adaptive sampling schemes are based on minimizing the prediction error of the QOI.  This is a good philosophy, and one we embrace in this research.  However, as this approach is typically implemented, the surrogate models or their error bounds do not make sufficient use of the output data, $\by$, to be effective.   We illustrate this weakness here for a popular family of surrogate models.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{RKHS or Kriging Surrogate Models} \label{sec:RKHSKrigSurrModel}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Suppose that the output map, $f$, belongs to an RKHS $\calf$.  A commonly used reproducing kernel is the following member of the Mat\'ern family:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MatKer}
    K(\bt,\bx) = (1 + \theta \norm[2]{\bt-\bx}) \exp(-\theta\norm[2]{\bt-\bx}),
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is a parameter to be set or inferred.  See \cite{Buh00, Fas07a, FasMcC15a, ForFly15a, ForEtal09, SchWen06a, Wen05a} for an explanation of function approximation in RKHSs.  The minimum norm interpolant of $f$ in this $\calf$ is the surrogate model
\begin{equation} \label{appxExOne}
    \SURR(n,\mX,\by) = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i K(\cdot, \bx_i), \quad \text{where } \bc = \mK^{-1} \by, \quad \mK = \mK(\mX) = \bigl( K(\bx_i,\bx_j) \bigr)_{i,j=1}^n, 
\end{equation}
which has a known pointwise error bound of
\begin{align}
\label{RKHSErrBd}
    \abs{f(\bx) - \SURR(n,\mX,\by)(\bx)} & \le \sqrt{K(\bx,\bx) - \bk^T(\bx) \mK^{-1} \bk(\bx)} \, \norm[\calf]{f - \SURR(n,\mX,\by)} \\
    \nonumber
    & \le \sqrt{K(\bx,\bx) - \bk^T(\bx) \mK^{-1} \bk(\bx)} \, \norm[\calf]{f} \qquad \forall f \in \calf, \\
    \nonumber
    & \qquad \qquad \text{where }  \bk(\bx) = \bigl(K(\bx,\bx_i) \bigr)_{i=1}^n.
\end{align}

To make the error bound for the surrogate model data driven, let $\calc$ be the cone of functions whose norms are approximated modestly well by the norms of their surrogates:  
\begin{align}  \label{RKHScone}
    \calc &:= \Bigl\{f \in \calf : \norm[\calf]{f - \SURR(n,\mX,\by)} \le A_n \bignorm[\calf]{\SURR(n,\mX,\by)} \Bigr \} \\
    \nonumber
    & = \Bigl\{f \in \calf : \norm[\calf]{f}^2 \le (1 + A_n^2) \bignorm[\calf]{\SURR(n,\mX,\by)}^2 \Bigr \},
\end{align}
where $A_n$ is positive, and fixed in advance.  This $\calc$ is a cone because if $f \in \calc$, then $c f \in \calc$ for any real $c$.  The intuition in defining this cone is: \emph{what you cannot see is not much worse than what you can see}. All adaptive algorithms are based on this assumption.  The definition of the cone in \eqref{RKHScone} is a way of formalizing this key idea. Noting that $\bignorm[\calf]{\SURR(n,\mX,\by)} = \sqrt{\by \mK^{-1} \by}$ error bound \eqref{RKHSErrBd} then implies an error bound that can be computed solely based on the output data: 
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:DataErrBd}
\begin{gather}
    \abs{f(\bx) - \SURR(n,\mX,\by)(\bx)} \le \SURRERR(,n,\mX,\by)(\bx) \qquad \forall f \in \calc, \\
        \label{eq:DataErrBda} 
   \text{where } \SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)(\bx) : = A_n \sqrt{[K(\bx,\bx) - \bk^T(\bx) \mK^{-1} \bk(\bx)] \, [\by^T \mK^{-1} \by] }.
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
This data-driven error bound for the surrogate model now leads to acquisition functions in \eqref{eq:QOIval} and error bounds in \eqref{eq:QOIerr} for the two QOIs in \eqref{eq:ourQOIs} with their approximations in \eqref{eq:QOIhat}.

One may question why the surrogate error bound in \eqref{eq:DataErrBd} only applies to some subset, $\calc$, of the space, $\calf$, of possible functions, $f$.  Since $\calf$ is infinite dimensional, no matter what $n$ output data are observed, there is always some $f_\perp \in\calf$ that is zero at every data site.  The numerical approximations, $\APP(f \pm c f_\perp)$, must be the same for all $c$, while the true solutions  $\QOI(f + c f_\perp)$ and  $\QOI(f - c f_\perp)$ can be made arbitrarily far apart for large enough $c$.  Thus, the same surrogate error bound cannot apply for all $f + c f_\perp$.

The deterministic framework using RKHSs for $f$ has a parallel Bayesian interpretation promoted by Diaconis \cite{Dia88a} and pursued by many others \cite{BriEtal18a, OHa91a, OwhEtal19a, RasWil06a, Rit00a}.  It assumes that $f$ is an instance of $\GP(0,K)$, a Gaussian process with mean zero\footnote{There is also value in assuming a simple polynomial form for the mean, just as the RKHS approach may be extended to reproduce polynomials exactly. We will explore such ideas in our research.} and covariance kernel, $K$.  In this case the posterior mean of $f(x)$ given the data $(\mX,\by)$ is called a kriging model and has the same expression as $\SURR(n,\mX,\by)$ as in \eqref{appxExOne}, and width of the pointwise credible interval for the surrogate model is the same as $\SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)$ in \eqref{eq:DataErrBd}, with $A_{10} \approx 1$ determined by empirical Bayes.  In this research we will adopt the deterministic and/or Bayesian approach, depending on which better suits our needs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{A Univariate Example of the RKHS/Kriging Approach} \label{sec:UnivarEx}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To illustrate the RKHS approach, Fig.\ \ref{fig:sampleFun} displays the univariate function
\begin{equation} \label{eq:univarfun}
f \colon x \mapsto \exp(-6x) \sin(8x+0.1)
\end{equation}
and its surrogate model $\SURR(10,\mX,\by)$ based on the $n=10$ point design $\mX = (0, 0.1, \ldots, 0.6, 0.8,\linebreak 0.9, 1)^T$ and the Mat\'ern kernel in \eqref{eq:MatKer} with $\theta =1$.  
Although not highly accurate, $\SURR(10,\mX,\by)$ captures the peak on the left because the data sites are dense enough there.  If the design consists only of the $n=4$ sparse data sites, $\mX = (0, 0.4,  0.6, 1)^T$, then $\SURR(4,\mX,\by)$ misses the peak, as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:sampleFun}. This demonstrates the need for the sufficient samples in the explore stage highlighted in Sect.\ \ref{sec:OurPlan}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 7cm]{ProgramsImages/fandDataAndAppxSmall.eps} \qquad \qquad
    \includegraphics[width = 7cm]{ProgramsImages/fandDataAndAppxAndRMSPEAndMin.eps}
    \caption{The left plot shows $f: x \mapsto \exp(-6x) \sin(8x+0.1)$ and its surrogate model \eqref{appxExOne} using $10$ and $4$ data sites and the kernel \eqref{eq:MatKer} with $\theta = 1$. Too few date sites yields a poor approximation.  The right plot includes the surrogate model prediction error bound, $\SURRERR(10,\mX,\by)$ from \eqref{eq:DataErrBda} with $A_{10} =1$, and the location of the largest prediction error, $x_{\ID,11}$. The largest true error occurs far away from $x_{\ID,11}$.}
    \label{fig:sampleFun}
\end{figure}

There is a substantial literature on $d$-dimensional space filling designs \cite{FangEtal19a, Jos16a, SanWilNot03}. The number of data sites required for the initial design depends on i) how many one can afford, ii) how narrow a peak one is willing to miss, and iii) the number of independent variables, $d$.

The next data sites for both the function approximation and minimization problems using our adaptive rule \eqref{eq:nextsample} with the acquisition functions \eqref{eq:QOIval} and $A_{10}$ are plotted on the right in Fig.\ \ref{fig:sampleFun}.  Note that $x_{\ID, 11} = x_{\MIN, 11}$ and $f(x_{\ID, 11}) \approx \SURR(11,\mX,\by)(x_{\ID, 11})$, so  sampling at $x_{\ID, 11}$ does not help much.  

The adaptive sampling rule outlined here performs poorly for this example for several reasons.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The form of the kernel, $K$, is not influenced by the output data, $\by$.
    
    \item The pointwise surrogate error bound in \eqref{eq:DataErrBd} depends weakly on the output data $\by$.  The fact that the function is observed to fluctuate more on the left does not influence this surrogate error bound, $\SURRERR(n,\mX,\by)$.  In fact, $\bx_{\ID,11}$ is not affected by $\by$ at all.
    
    \item As a consequence of the first two points, the surrogate error bound is tight on the left, but quite loose on the right. 
\end{itemize}
The shortcomings highlighted here do not speak against the idea of choosing to sample next where the prediction error is largest.  Rather, our surrogate models and their uncertainties must become more sophisticated.  Remedies are proposed in Sects.\ \ref{sec:Bootstrap} and \ref{sec:kerinferdata}.

Sect.\  \ref{sec:UnivarEx} highlights some of the drawbacks of sampling in a way to minimize prediction error arising from RKHS or kriging models.  While we value the underlying approach, the models and their uncertainties or errors are not well adapted to the functions being approximated or optimized.

One improvement is to infer the value of $\theta$ inherent in the defintion of $K$ in \eqref{eq:MatKer} rather than to set it arbitrarily. The empirical Bayes perspective leads to the following choice \cite{Hic17a}: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:thetEB}
    \theta_{\textup{EB}} = \argmin_\theta \left[\frac 1n \log \bigl( \det(\mK_\theta) \bigr) + \log \bigl ( \by^T \mK_\theta^{-1} \by \bigr)\right].
\end{equation}
For the example $f$ in \eqref{eq:univarfun}, $\theta_{\textup{EB}} = 11$, and the resulting approximation and approximate error bound are given on the left of Fig.\ \ref{fig:InferKernel}.  Unforutnately, the new surrogate model has similar deficiencies as the original one in Sect.\ \ref{sec:UnivarEx}, and the suggested next data site is at a place where the function approximation is already quite good.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 7cm]{ProgramsImages/fandDataAndAppxAndRMSPEOpt.eps} \qquad \qquad
    \includegraphics[width = 7cm]{ProgramsImages/fandDataAndAppxAndRMSPEOpty.eps}
    \caption{The left plot shows the function approximation with an error bound for the example $f$ in \eqref{eq:univarfun} but with $\theta = \theta_{\textup{EB}} = 11$ rather than $\theta =1$.  The approximation is slightly better than in Fig.\ \ref{fig:sampleFun}, but the surrogate error bound is much larger.  The right plot shows the the function approximation with the surrogate error bound for the example $f$ in \eqref{eq:univarfun} but for the modified Mat\`ern kernel in \eqref{modMatKer}, and now with $\theta = \theta_{\textup{EB}} = 5.3$ and $S = S_{\textup{EB}} = -6.0$.  The approximation is much improved, especially for smaller $x$, and the error bound is much smaller.  The next data sites for function approximation and optimization are in locations that makes intuitive sense.}
    \label{fig:InferKernel}
\end{figure}

A more helpful approach is to generalize the Mat\'ern kernel as follows to allow for the variation of the functions to be greater in one part of the domain than the other:
\begin{equation} \label{modMatKer}
    K(t,x) = \exp(S(t+x))(1 + \theta \abs{t-x}) \exp(-\theta\abs{t-x}).
\end{equation}
Here we have considered the case $d=1$.  This new kernel maintains its properties of being symmetric and positive definite because all we have done is to multiply the original kernel by $g(t)g(x)$ for some function $g$.  Here $S$ is a parameter to be inferred.

The right plot in Fig.\ \ref{fig:InferKernel} shows the minimum norm approximation and the approximate error bound for the example in \eqref{eq:univarfun}, but for this modified Mat\'ern kernel in \eqref{modMatKer} and both parameters $\theta$ and $S$ being determined by empirical Bayes as in \eqref{eq:thetEB}.  The approximation fits the true function much better and the error bound captures the true function better.  The next data site for function approximation, $x_{\ID,11}$, is in a region where $f$ varies greatly.  The next data site for optimization, $x_{\MIN,11}$,  is on the side of the observed minimum where $f$ fluctuates more.

This example of \emph{modifying a well-known kernel so that data-based inference of the parameters produce a better approximation} and a better adaptive sampling scheme is proof of concept.  We plan to extend this idea to a more general multivariate setting.  Some of the challenges will be to ensure that our modified kernels are not overfit and specifying a mathematically precise set of functions for which this approach is successful.

Another area weakness in the adaptive scheme outlined above is that the cone $\calc$ of reasonable functions defined in  \eqref{RKHScone} depends strongly on the specific design chosen, $\mX$.  We would rather that the definition of $\calc$ rely only on the design satisfying some modest properties, such as the $\bx_i$ filling  $\Omega$ relatively well.  This is also a question for research.

\subsection{Selecting Important Coordinate Directions} \label{sec:selectCoord}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To approximate or optimize a $d$-variate function using $n$ output data, where $d$ is in the dozens, and $n$ is restricted to the thousands, the function $f$ cannot be fully $d$ dimensional.  For example, even a multilinear function,
\begin{equation*}
    f(\bx) = a_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_{1,2} x_1 x_2 + \cdots + a_{1,\ldots, d}x_1 \cdots x_d, \qquad \bx \in [-1,1]^d,
\end{equation*}
requires at least $n = 2^d$ output data to approximate or optimize well.  Exponential growth in the sample size required for a reasonable solution is called the \emph{curse of dimensionality}.  There are several ways to overcome this curse, all of which boil down to defining an $\calc$ of reasonable functions that have an essentially low-dimensional structure.  We highlight a couple that we will explore.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\fredparagraph{Coordinate Weights}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The tractability literature for continuous numerical problems (see \cite{DicEtal14a,NovWoz08a, NovWoz10a, NovWoz12a} and the references therein), has shown that the growth in the sample size, $n$, required to solve a problem involving $d$ POIs to an error of $\varepsilon$ can be reduced from exponential to merely polynomial growth in $d$, or even a constant with respect to $d$ if the coordinates can be ordered so that their importance decays sufficiently fast.  

As an example, one might modify the Mat\'ern kernel in \eqref{eq:MatKer} as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MatKer}
    K(\bt,\bx) = \prod_{\ell = 1}^d (1 + \theta_\ell \abs{t_\ell-x_\ell}) \exp(-\theta_\ell \abs{t_\ell-x_\ell}).
\end{equation}
If $\theta_\ell$ is small, then $K$ depends weakly on the $\ell^{\text{th}}$ POI, and the functions $f$ in the RKHS defined by this kernel depend weakly on the $\ell^{\text{th}}$ POI.  It was shown in \cite{FasHicWoz12b, FasHicWoz12a} for a different kernel that function approximation avoids the curse of dimensionality if the $\theta_\ell$ decay quickly enough.

For some problems, one can guess the order of importance of the coordinates, but in our intended applications, this is not the case.  Therefore, we will explore how to infer the coordinate weights from our exploratory sample.  This might be via empirical Bayes (Sect.\ \ref{sec:kerinferdata}) or some other means such as that suggested in \cite{DinHic20a}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\fredparagraph{Active Subspaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An alternative to permuting the original POIs in order of importance is to rotate the original POIs to obtain a new coordinate system whose variables are arranged in order of their importance.  This approach described as identifying active subspaces and is championed in \cite{constantine2015active}.  We will also explore whether this approach can help us avoid the curse of dimensionality.

For distance weighted least squares the common Euclidean distance becomes problematic for large $d$.  Therefore, in applying this algorithm we expect to employ some non-homogeneous concept of distance involving coordinate weights or identification of active subspaces.

\subsection{Contributions to Training, Mentoring and Other Human Resource Developments}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
FJH and JMH lead regular research group meetings at their respective instituions comprised of long-term and short-term student 
collaborators, visitors, the curious, and special guests.  Ongoing work in early or polished stages is shared.  Papers of other authors are presented.  Mentoring takes place during these meetings as well as individually.

\fredparagraph{Providing Research Experiences for Undergraduate and High School Students.} We request funds 
to 
support two summer undergraduate students per year at Illinois Tech. As in the past, we expect the NSF funds will serve as a catalyst for funds to 
support additional summer students. In choosing summer students we will make a deliberate effort to 
build 
a diverse research environment by targeting female and underrepresented minority students as well 
as students from less research-focused institutions (see Sect.~\ref{prevBIsect}). We will also 
welcome well-prepared high school students to join our research group.

\fredparagraph{Preparing Students for Academic Careers.} Mentoring is a multi-faceted and 
potentially long-term process continuing even after the mentee has moved on from Illinois Tech.  
Our PhD students gain experience in both research and mentoring the younger students in our 
research group.  We 
continue contact with many of our former students, in particular Yiou Li (female).  We will continue to help our students prepare for 
academic careers and continue mentoring them after they leave Illinois Tech.

\fredparagraph{Preparing Students for Industry Careers.}
We also help current students land 
competitive jobs in the business world. Our training in the areas of computation and software 
development gives our students the needed edge in comparison to other mathematics 
graduates. For example, LlAJR and XZ are working in the financial services industry and  LJ is 
working in marketing analytics.  All of them are developing and testing quantitatively sophisticated 
and computationally intensive models. 

% \emph{Supervising Visitors.}
% Both FJH and YD have strong connections to East Asia.  We have hosted several long-term 
% self-funded visitors in the past and plan to do so in the future.

\fredparagraph{Giving Tutorials and Invited Lectures.}
We will continue providing lectures to students at various stages in their careers, ranging from high
school to graduate school. These encourage students to enter STEM and encourage STEM students 
to engage in research in general, and this research area in particular.

\subsection{Contributions to Resources in Research, Education and the Broader Society} 
\label{BroaderTwoSec}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The proposed research straddles mathematics, statistics, theoretical computer science, and 
application areas.  The PIs have complementary strengths that facilitate this interdisciplinary research.  YD has expertise in adaptive algorithms and software development.  FJH has expertise in adaptive algorithms, low discrepancy sampling, kernel-based methods, and tractability. JMH has expertise in modeling of large scale phenomena and algorithm development.  Our 
expertise provides both an obligation and an opportunity to interact with a number of diverse 
communities. We envision the following contributions:

\fredparagraph{Disseminating Research and Writing Survey Papers}
The research supported by this grant will result in publications in peer-reviewed journals in applied
mathematics, computer science, statistics, and science/engineering. These 
journals will include both those that emphasize theory and those that emphasize applications.  The PIs will continue their practice of writing tutorial, survey, and encyclopedia articles.  These will make our findings accessible to a wider audience.


\fredparagraph{Organizing and Presenting at Conferences}
We and our students involved in this project will present our results at a variety of conferences and workshops.  These include: (i) specialized meetings focusing on approximation theory, complexity, 
experimental design, Monte Carlo methods, and probabilistic numerics; (ii) the national meetings of AMS, SIAM, and the 
statistical societies; and (iii) conferences devoted to application areas.  We are frequently invited to 
speak at such conferences, which will give our results a prominent hearing. We will also continue to 
organize specialized conferences or minisymposia within larger conferences.

\fredparagraph{Bridging Applied Mathematics and Statistics}
This project touches on topics that are of interest to the statistics community: kriging, Monte Carlo methods, probabilistic numerics, and design of experiments.  We have and will continue to engage the statistics community 
by speaking a their conferences and departmental colloquia.

\fredparagraph{Establishing a Paradigm for Adaptive Algorithms} The idea of guaranteed, adaptive algorithms via cones of reasonable input 
functions has broad potential application.  We will continue to promote this idea among numerical analysts 
who 
develop new algorithms and analyze their computational costs, as well as among information-based 
complexity theorists who analyze the lower bounds on the complexity of numerical problems.  The recent work by Kunsch, Novak, and Rudolf \cite{KunEtal19a} shows that the idea of cones is catching on.


\emph{Creating Software and Collaborating with Software Developers.}
As the complexity of large scale numerical computations increase rapidly, mundane operations such as integration and function approximation are taken for granted. We must construct reliable adaptive algorithms for these problems so that there are no unwelcome surprises for the practitioner when she takes them for granted.

We will continue to develop \GAIL \citep{ChoEtal17b} (now up to version 2.2).  The \GAIL software 
will serve the wider community that relies on numerical approximation and integration algorithms.  It will 
also demonstrate how adaptive algorithms ought to be implemented, which we hope will inspire and 
inform those working on adaptive algorithms for other mathematical problems.  We will involve 
students in porting \GAIL to other platforms, such as Python, \Rlang, and \Julia.  

In the summer of 2018, we began engaging with other \QMC research groups about combining our software efforts.  These included the groups of Mike Giles (Oxford, Multi-Level Monte Carlo),  Frances Kuo (UNSW, \QMC generators, PDEs with random coefficients),  Dirk Nuyens (KU Leuven, \QMC generators, PDEs with random coefficients), and Christoph Schwab (ETH-Zurich, PDEs with random coefficients).  All of these groups have significant software development efforts, but our software libraries are not compatible with one another.  We have begun discussing a common framework for a shared community quasi-Monte Carlo software library, \QMCSoft.  If all groups would write their software to the specifications of this framework, then improvements and additions would immediately work with the other parts of the library.

We will collaborate with these other research groups to move our software to this common framework.  Given the difficulty in agreeing upon one language, this may be a multi-language effort.  We will seek resources outside this proposal to support this effort.  As the \QMC community embraces \QMCSoft, we expect our core of contributors to grow.  Scholars who develop new \QMC algorithms or use \QMC in applications will be encouraged to add them to \QMCSoft.  

We expect our new algorithms to be incorporated into widely used numerical packages, as was done for our algorithm in \cite{HonHic00a} by \MATLAB and \NAG.  We have already and will continue 
to discuss with software developers about good practices for adaptive algorithms.


\emph{New Applications of \QMC.}
The application of \QMC has focused on a few areas, such as financial modeling and computer 
graphics, but there is potential for much wider application.  LlAJR has collaborated with Fermilab implementing \QMC algorithms, and we plan to continue.    New applications of \QMC are arising from \SAMSIQMC that we plan to pursue.  KZ is exploring how to use adaptive \QMC to more efficiently perform Bayesian inference.

\section{Project Management and Collaboration}
This research will be primarily conducted at Illinois Tech, Tulane U, and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), where JMH has a courtesy appointment.  FJH will lead the effort at Illinois Tech, and JMH will lead the effort at Tulane.  FJH and YD will focus on the theoretical analysis of the algorithms, including error bounds for the surrogate models.  They will also lead the exploration of the data-inferred reproducing/covariance kernels.  JMH will focus on the design of our novel algorithms, including the weighted least squares and the Bayesian bootstrap.  He will also lead the application of our new algorithms to the large-scale application problems.  

The PhD student will be based at Illinois Tech during the academic year under the direct supervision of FJH and YD.  The PhD student will work on part of the algorithmic developments, its theoretical analysis, and its implementation in freely available software.  During the summer, the PhD student will join JMH in Los Alamos and be involved with testing our algorithms on challenging application problems.  The undergraduate students will work either at Illinois Tech or at LANL during the summer exploring interesting bite-sized aspects of the algorithms and their performance.

Our research groups will meet regularly via video conference and in person a couple of times per year at one of our campuses or at conferences.
